# MedTracker ⚕️🚑🩺

## Description

The goal of this application is to fetch data from OpenFDA API about medications that the user will enter. Maybe the user is looking for specific information that the cannot easily be assertained or they are unfamiliar with the means of delivery for example. This app fetches that data for them, it allows them to login and in future iterations of our app, they will be able to log out. Moreoever, the data yield is currently produced in the console. Future development would have us extrapolate that data from the console and put it on the page. This the MVP that we were able to produce given tight time frame.
